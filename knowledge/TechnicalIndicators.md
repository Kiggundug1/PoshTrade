2. Bollinger Bands: A volatility indicator that consists of a moving average and two standard deviation lines that represent the upper and lower boundaries of the expected price range.

3. Relative Strength Index (RSI): A momentum indicator that measures the strength of price changes to identify overbought and oversold conditions.

4. Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD): A trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of an asset's price.

5. Stochastic Oscillator: A momentum indicator that compares the closing price of an asset to its price range over a specified period to identify overbought and oversold conditions.

6. Fibonacci Retracement: A tool used to identify potential levels of support and resistance by measuring the retracement levels of a price trend.

7. Ichimoku Cloud: A trend-following indicator that shows support and resistance levels, momentum, and trend direction.

10. Momentum indicators: Other momentum indicators you could consider include the Moving Average Ribbon, the Rate of Change (ROC) indicator, and the Williams %R indicator.

11. Oscillators: In addition to the Stochastic Oscillator, other oscillators you could use include the Commodity Channel Index (CCI), the Relative Vigor Index (RVI), and the Money Flow Index (MFI).

## Potential strengths and weaknesses

Some of the most commonly used technical indicators in algorithmic trading include Moving Averages, Relative Strength Index (RSI), Stochastic Oscillator, Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), and Bollinger Bands.

Moving Averages are used to identify trends in the market by smoothing out price fluctuations, making them easier to interpret. RSI is used to measure the momentum of a stock's price, and to determine whether it is overbought or oversold. Stochastic Oscillator is another momentum indicator that compares the closing price of a stock to its price range over a set period of time, helping to identify potential reversal points. MACD is a trend-following momentum indicator that uses moving averages to identify changes in momentum, and Bollinger Bands use standard deviations to measure a stock's volatility and identify potential buy and sell signals.
