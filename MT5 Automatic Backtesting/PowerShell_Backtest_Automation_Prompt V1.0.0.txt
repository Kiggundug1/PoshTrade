I want to automate the process of Opening MT5 "C:\Program Files\MetaTrader 5 EXNESS\terminal64.exe", Open Strategy tester (Ctrl + R), select "C:\Users\GodfreyKiggundu\AppData\Roaming\MetaQuotes\Terminal\53785E099C927DB68A545C249CDBCE06\MQL5\Experts\Custom EAs\Moving Average EURUSD M15.ex5" expert advisor, and backtest it on "EURUSDm", 15M timeframe, From 2019-01-01 to 2024-12-31, Deposit 10000, Currency "USD", Leverage "1:2000", "Visual Mode" on and then start the backtest; wait for it to complete and save the report in xml. How best can I archieve this?, which platform or software or program can I use?
